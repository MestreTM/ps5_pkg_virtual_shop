**PS5 PKG Virtual Shop** is a simple yet powerful web-based interface for managing and installing your local PS4/PS5 `.pkg` files on a jailbroken PlayStation 5.  
The application runs on your computer and serves a clean, controller-friendly web UI directly to your PS5‚Äôs browser, allowing one-click installation via **etaHEN‚Äôs Direct Package Installer**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention - At the moment the script only accepts the ps4 PKG format.

## üìò About the Project

This project provides a **graphical user interface** to manage a local collection of `.pkg` files for a jailbroken PS5.  
Instead of typing URLs manually or using command-line tools, this server scans your local folders, extracts metadata (like titles and icons), and presents everything in a **categorized, console-friendly storefront**.

It is built with a **Python Flask backend** and a **lightweight vanilla JavaScript frontend**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the server running on your computer.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MestreTM/ps5_pkg_virtual_shop.git
cd ps5_pkg_virtual_shop
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python dependencies

Using a virtual environment is recommended.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required libraries
pip install Flask Pillow
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure your library

When you first run the server, it will create a `configs.json` file automatically.  
Alternatively, you can create it manually in the project root.

Example `configs.json`:

```json
{
    "shop_title": "My PS5 Library",
    "paths": {
        "games": "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Documents\\PS5\\PKG\\Games",
        "apps": "/home/user/ps5/apps",
        "dlc": "D:\\PKG_Collection\\DLC",
        "updates": "/path/to/your/updates"
    }
}
```

- **shop_title:** The main title displayed in the web interface.  
- **paths:** A dictionary where each key represents a category (tab name) and each value is the folder path containing `.pkg` files.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the server

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start and display which folders are being monitored.  
The first scan may take some time if you have a large collection ‚Äî subsequent scans will be faster thanks to caching.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### üîß Find your Computer‚Äôs IP Address

- **Windows:** Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
- **macOS/Linux:** Open a terminal and type `ifconfig` or `ip -a`

Look for your **IPv4 Address**, which should look like `192.168.1.100`.

### üåê Open on your PS5

On your PS5, open the web browser and navigate to:

```
http://<YOUR_PC_IP>:5000
```

Replace `<YOUR_PC_IP>` with the IP address you found earlier.

### üõí Browse and Install

- Tabs will represent each category.  
- Use **L2/R2** to switch between tabs.  
- Use **Next/Previous** to navigate through pages.  
- Click any game or app card to **install directly** to your PS5 via **etaHEN**.
